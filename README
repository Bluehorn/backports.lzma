I want to be able to use XY compressed files (and maybe LZMA files)
under older versions of Python, so decided to backport 'lzma' from
Python 3.3.

Python 3.3 onwards includes in the standard library module 'lzma',
providing support for working with LZMA and XY compressed files via
the XZ Utils C library (XY Utils is in a sense LZMA v2). I'm not
sure why they Python module is still called 'lzma', but it is.

* Python's lzma - http://docs.python.org/dev/library/lzma.html
* XZ Utils - http://tukaani.org/xz/

There are some older Python libraries like PylibLZMA and PyLZMA
but these are both using LZMA Utils (not XY Utils, so they have
no XY support).

* PylibLZMA - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyliblzma
* PyLZMA - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylzma/
* LZMA Utils - http://tukaani.org/lzma/
